# iA Writer Templates
I wasn't quite satisfied with the templates available, so i made my own based on [iA's](https://ia.net/writer/templates) Helvetica template. Might add some more in the future.

## iawriter-lato
[Download](/download/iawriter-lato.iatemplate.zip)

Modern Sans Template, uses the popular _Lato_ for Body and _ZillaSlab_ for Headings. 

## iawriter-script
[Download](/download/iawriter-script.iatemplate.zip)

This one features _PTSans_ and _PTSerif_, which are incredibly easy to read. 
I scaled up the font-size to 13.5pt and line-height to 1.9 for even better readability after printing. 

Try this if you prefer printing things out and reading from paper. Should also work fine when giving speeches etc.
