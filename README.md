# iA Writer Templates
I wasn't quite satisfied with the templates available, so i made my own based on [iA's](https://ia.net/writer/templates) Helvetica template. Might add some more in the future.

## iawriter-lato
[Download](/download/iawriter-lato.iatemplate.zip)

Clean Sans Template, uses _Lato_ for Body and _ZillaSlab_ for Headings.

IIRC, further changes were made to: 
- text alignment
- font size
- page margins
- header/footer
