# iA Writer Templates
I wasn't quite satisfied with the templates available, so i made my own based on [iA's](https://ia.net/writer/templates) Helvetica template. Might add some more in the future.

## iawriter-lato
[Download](/download/iawriter-lato.iatemplate.zip)

Clean Sans Template, uses _Lato_ for Body and _ZillaSlab_ for Headings.

IIRC, further changes were made: 
- text alignment
- slightly increased font size
- smaller page margins

## iawriter-script
[Download](/download/iawriter-script.iatemplate.zip)

This one features _PTSans_ and _PTSerif_, which are incredibly easy to read. 
I scaled up the font-size and line-height for even better readability after printing. 

Try this if you are giving a speech and do not have a telemprompter around.
